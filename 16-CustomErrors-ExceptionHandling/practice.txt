1. Write a program that opens a file and reads its content. Use try-except-finally to handle FileNotFoundError.

2. Ask the user for a positive number. Raise a ValueError if the input is zero or negative.

3. Create a custom exception OutOfRangeError and raise it if a number is not between 1 and 100.

4. Write a program that divides two numbers. Catch and handle ZeroDivisionError and ValueError. Use finally to print "Done."

5. Modify the password validation example to raise a custom exception if:
The password is < 6 characters
It doesnâ€™t contain a digit

(Hint: Create a WeakPasswordError class.)
