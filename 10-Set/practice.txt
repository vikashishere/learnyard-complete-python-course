1. Remove Duplicates from a List
nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
# Write code to remove duplicates and print sorted result

2. Find Common Items Between Two Lists
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]
# Use sets to print the common elements

3. Set Difference
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = [3, 4, 6]
# Print elements in a but not in b

4. Fast Membership Check
words = ["apple", "banana", "grape", "orange"]
# Convert to set and check if "grape" exists
